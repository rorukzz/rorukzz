Greetings,

My name is Rory, originally hailing from Nelson, New Zealand, and currently, I call Melbourne, Australia, my home.

As a dedicated Data Analyst, I invest significant time enhancing my proficiency in Python and leveraging Pandas for comprehensive Data Analysis.

Though primarily focused on data analytics, I maintain a passion for website development, occasionally dedicating time to this endeavor. I'm keen to contribute to various projects and offer my expertise wherever it may be valuable.

Feel free to reach out to discuss any community initiatives or collaborative projects you have in mind.
